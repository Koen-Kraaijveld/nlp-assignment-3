# descrAIbe it (NLP Assignment 3)
The web app [descrAIbe it](https://descraibe.onrender.com/) it is based on a game in which players are given a word and are tasked with describing
it as best they can without using the word itself. A player can score points if they get it right, otherwise their
score is reset back to zero and they must start over. Every round consists of a word being randomly sampled
from a pool of 100 unique words. For every word description a player submits, they are also given the class
probabilities associated with their answer in descending order.
